			            <h4>Seeking to better understand the back end office, and most importantly not only knows the tools but also develop my abilities to use them I followed classes of R, Python, and SQL.
			            To ensure to be efficient, I developed an analysis on R using statistical code. Through Python, the classes allowed me to study the basis of this code but also give me all keys to be autonomous to apply it on basics Machine Learning or Data Mining problems. I aslo used Python to analyze the samples gathered on my thesis on "The influence of Voice and Chat interface on the engagement of a user towards a brand". Finally, SQL is an essential tool when we come to data analysis to ease the correlation within the data.</h4>

Regarding that, I was able to use the tools Tableau Software, Watson and Power Bi, besides Excel, to drive insightful dashboards for managers.

Not only I launched campaigns on those platforms but I also created some content (Google Ads, Facebook Ads Manager, Linkedin Ads, Bing Ads). To ensure the relevance of my campaigns, I did some optimization and A/B Testing through those platforms. The results were outstanding on several clients compared to the previous period and some even doubled their goals.</h4>

			            <h4>Studying around the world in Canada, Morocco, South Korea, France, and China allowed me to develop my communication skills. Those experiences pushed me to understand the full context and culture to be able to improve communication within multi-cultural teams. During those experiences, I was able to write and communicate orally in English, French, and Spanish in front of a class or during conferences. Besides that, I always studied double competences, Marketing & Finance at HEC Montreal and then Digital Marketing & Data Science at EM Lyon allowing me to better understand the reality of different people within a team. I believe it will help me to work more efficiently in multi-disciplinary teams.</h4>
